# Ruby Practice

Run your Ruby file by typing `ruby ` and then the name of the file you want to run in the Terminal.

If we want to run `integer_math.rb`, we can write the command:

```bash
ruby integer_math.rb
```

To re-run this command, you can use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to look at the history of commands you've run in a Terminal.

## Integer

### integer_math
If you divide the number of days in a regular year by the number of days in a week, what's the remainder?

Your output should be a number; for example,
```
4
```

### integer_odd
It should ask the user to enter a number (using `gets`) and output `true` or `false` if the entered number is odd.

Example (`13` is the input):
```bash
"Enter an odd number:"
13
true
```

Example (`12` is the input):
```bash
"Enter an odd number:"
12
false
```
